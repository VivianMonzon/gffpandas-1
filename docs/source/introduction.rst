What is gffpandas?
==================

| gffpandas is a Python library, which can be used to work with annotation data. It facilitates the work with gff3 files in regard to filter desired annotation entries of the gff3 file. Thereby, it is an easy to use library and time safing.
| This gffpandas library is an alternative to e.g. gffutils, but it is inspired by the Python library Pandas. This means that the data frame structure is used to work with the annotation data. With gffpandas it is possible to filter a gff3 file by different functions. Another big adventage is that several filter functions can be combined so that the required annotation entries can be selected. Furthermore, can be the filtered annotation data be safed again as gff3 file or as csv or tsv file.
